If there's an error in the database, or you just want to initiallise it, run reset.py

The data for this database is sourced from [GP Racing Stats](https://gpracingstats.com/).

**Limitations:** 
- It only contains race and sprint results, not qualifying, free practice, testing, or other sessions which do not award championship points.
- This is *very* dependent on GP Racing Stats. If they don't update the result, it doesn't come here.
